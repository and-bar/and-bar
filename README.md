Greetings to all who have visited my profile @and-bar. I am Andriy, deeply engaged in the fascinating world of Reinforcement Learning. My current focus lies in bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and their practical applications. I am always open to discussions and connections. Python is my primary scripting language, and I am continually honing my skills in this versatile tool. Feel free to reach out with any inquiries or collaborations.
